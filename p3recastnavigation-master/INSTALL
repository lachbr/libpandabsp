Installation Instructions
*************************
To build and install p3recastnavigation, follow these instructions.
Clone the source:

 git clone https://github.com/consultit/p3recastnavigation.git

Enter the source folder and tweak config.ini as desired; in particular, you can 
change the optimization level, as by putting optimize=1 or 2 would compile the 
support for the debug drawing.
Then executes:
 
 python build.py 
 
Everytime you update the library or change configuration (config.ini) issue this
command
 
 python build.py --clean
 
In doubt issue always this last command.
 
Note: p3recastnavigation uses a slightly modified version of "Panda Module 
Builder" by tobspr (https://github.com/tobspr/P3DModuleBuilder) as build system,
so refer to that for more informations.

To install copy (or link) the generated p3recastnavigation module into the 
folder containing  your code, and into your code put imports similar to these:

 import panda3d.core
 from p3recastnavigation import *
 ...
 
That's all.
